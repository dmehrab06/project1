Hey babe its me
barking outside your house
i know that he is asleep
so listen to me now
darling i am just tired living in your dream
i am living out now
we both sold our souls
we are just growing old
in this sleepy dead end town
destination anywhere
name the place and i will be there
pack a bag and we are out of here
lets run
